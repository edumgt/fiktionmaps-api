## About the project
The project is in its early stages and, although I am not the first to conceive such an idea - as many have walked this path before me - it took shape when I realized a pattern: the places I have lived in were not chosen at random, but were significantly influenced by the fictions I related to. 
I lived in Sweden because of Stieg Larsson's "Millennium". In Croatia, I was drawn to the charm of "Game of Thrones" and its cats. Now in New York, because of Woody Allen movies.
